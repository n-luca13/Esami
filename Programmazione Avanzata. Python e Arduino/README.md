## Advanced Programming: Python and Arduino
#### Exam taken on June 7th, 2022 | 30L

:muscle: First attempt to Python & Arduino!

- :memo: **Pattern search in matrix with Python**
  - Given a matrix containing 0 and 1 values, check for specific patterns of the same format, even if rotated.
  - The zeros do not count: matching is based only on the numbers one
  - The use of libraries for matrix analysis is not allowed
  - Some of the first functions I wrote are awkward but I preferred to leave them there, if just to keep track of my progress.

- :grey_question: **Pattern input and display with Arduino** 
  - No requirement was specified
  - I decided to link these projects, using Arduino in order to let the user input the pattern to look for within the given matrix
  - Thanks to the implementation of Arduino I discovered and fixed some unexpected behaviour of the python script.
